This is a simple LDAP Browser using Spring Boot. application.properties configures the ldap server. change as needed.
depending on the ldap server you may need to modify the code for the connection.

this code is using the Apache LDAP API so it should be able to work with just about any LDAP server.

nothing fancy. keep that in mind :)
